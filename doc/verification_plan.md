# Verification Plan: RISC-V RV32I Pipelined Processor

## 1. Verification Goals

- 100% instruction correctness against the RISC-V ISA specification (RV32I v2.1)
- Functional coverage ≥ 95% on all defined covergroups
- Code coverage ≥ 90% (statement, branch, toggle)
- All pipeline hazard scenarios exercised

## 4. Covergroups

### 4.1 Instruction Type Coverage
- Bins for each of the 37 instructions
- Cross coverage: instruction type × source register (x0 vs non-x0)

### 4.2 Hazard Scenario Coverage
- Bins: no hazard, EX-EX forward, MEM-EX forward, load-use stall
- Cross: hazard type × instruction type

### 4.3 Branch Coverage
- Bins: taken vs not-taken for each of the 6 branch types
- Cross: branch direction × previous instruction type

### 4.4 ALU Operand Corner Cases
- Bins: zero, max positive, max negative, all-ones
- Cross: operand A corners × operand B corners × ALU operation

## 5. Scoreboard Strategy

The scoreboard contains a software reference model of the RV32I ISA.
For each instruction driven to the DUT:
1. The reference model executes the same instruction
2. The monitor captures the DUT's register write-back and memory writes
3. The scoreboard compares DUT output to reference model output
4. Any mismatch is flagged as `UVM_ERROR`

## 6. Regression Plan

| Suite | Contents | Run Frequency |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| Smoke | 1 directed test per instruction type | Every commit |
| Nightly | All directed + 10 random seeds | Daily |
| Full | All directed + 100 random seeds + corner cases | Weekly |
